->method override is only possible for non static methods.
when a method of parent class is overrided in the child class then even after upcasting,the child class method is executed

if we implement this for Static method,then it is called method hiding
->and in this scenario,the method is executed according to refference var type




POLYMORPHISM:(many forms)
    object showing different behaviour and attributes.
    two types:
        1.Compiletime polymorphism
            ->method overloading
                    it comes under the compiletime polymorphism because ,binding is done during compiling
            ->method hiding
            ->Variable shadowing
            ->constructor overloading
        2.runtime polymorphism
            =>method Overriding
                because of late binding.(binding during runtime by jvm)
